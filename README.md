ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

- Trying to build accessible dropdown menus / navigation bars with Svelte(Kit) and [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/).
  - Floating UI takes care of positioning dropdowns / popovers. It only detects resizing / scroll actions and positions dropdowns / popovers accordingly (https://blog.logrocket.com/popper-vs-floating-ui/)
- Based on https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/.
- Experimental, do not use this in production without serious a11y testing!

Live demo: https://svelte-floating-ui-a11y-menu.vercel.app/

## Local setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev -- --open`

## TODOs

- [ ] Add https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation-hybrid/#mythical-page-content example with top level links
- [ ] Decide whether to use `activeMenu` or compare with `equalNode()` to check if we clicked/touched the currently opened menu (avoid duplication)
- [x] Goal: Make hover work on iPads / big touch screen as well without need of collapsing the menu?
- [ ] Read https://adrianroselli.com/2019/06/link-disclosure-widget-navigation.html
- [ ] Use all keyboard events (arrow up, down) of https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html
- [x] Add https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-click-outside for closing
- [ ] Add collapsible mobile menu
- [ ] Test with screenreader(s)!
- [ ] Get feedback by a11y experts!
- [ ] Set focus properly?
- [ ] Fix contrast errors

## Technical

- I did not `{#if activeMenu == 'news'}` around `<ul>`-submenus, because this removes submenus temporarily completely from DOM. I wasn't sure if this was okay with aria-controls= references (https://stackoverflow.com/a/73391142). Drawback is, that you can't use Svelte animations like `in:fly={{ y: -10 }}` on these submenus. See https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7932 for more details.
