ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

Trying to build accessible dropdown menus / navigation bars with Svelte(Kit) and [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/). Floating UI takes care of positioning dropdowns.

Based on https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html.

Experimental, do not use this in production without serious a11y testing!

## Local setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev -- --open`

## TODOs

- [ ] Use source code of https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html
- [ ] Add collapsible mobile menu
- [ ] Add example where link and dropdown toggle are separated so that parent link can be clicked
- [ ] Implement other patterns
- [ ] Test with screenreader(s)!
- [ ] Get feedback by a11y experts
- [ ] Set focus properly
- [ ] Fix contrast errors

## Technical

- I did not `{#if activeMenu == 'news'}` around `<ul>`-submenus, because this removes submenus temporarily completely from DOM. I wasn't sure if this was okay with aria-controls= references (https://stackoverflow.com/a/73391142). Drawback is, that you can't use Svelte animations like `in:fly={{ y: -10 }}` on these submenus. See https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7932 for more details.
